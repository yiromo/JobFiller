# Progress log

Newest first. One entry per feature commit — added when the feature actually lands, not before.

## Done

- **Core backend skeleton** — Django 5 + DRF, uv-managed, SQLite, `GET /health/`. Verified:
  `ruff check`, `manage.py check`, `manage.py migrate`, curl'd `/health/` via `runserver` and
  again via a built Docker image (`docker build` + `docker run` + curl against the container).
- **Repo scaffold** — monorepo layout, root README, CLAUDE.md, tasks/.
